   "Hiring, managing, promoting, and firing executives. Posted on August 28, 2007\n\nOne of the most critical things a startup founder must do is develop a top-notch executive team. This is a topic that could fill a whole book, but in this post, I will provide specific guidelines on how to hire, manage, promote, and fire executives in a startup based on my personal observations and experiences.\n\nFor the purposes of this post, definitions:\n\nAn executive is a leader—someone who runs a function within the company and has primary responsibility for an organization within the company that will contribute to the company’s success or failure.\n\nThe difference between an executive and a manager is that the executive has a higher degree of latitude to organize, make decisions, and execute within her function than a manager. The manager may ask what the right thing to do is; the executive should know.\n\nThe general theory of executives, like managers, is, per Andy Grove: the output of an executive is the output of her organization. Therefore, the primary task of an executive is to maximize the output of her organization.\n\nHowever, in a startup, a successful executive must accomplish three other critical tasks simultaneously:\n\n1. Build her organization—typically when an executive arrives or is promoted into her role at a startup, she isn’t there to be a caretaker; rather she must build her organization, often from scratch. This is a sharp difference from many big company executives, who can spend their entire careers running organizations other people built—often years or decades earlier.\n\n2. Be a primary individual contributor—a startup executive must “roll up her sleeves” and produce output herself. There are no shortage of critical things to be done at a startup, and an executive who cannot personally produce while simultaneously building and running her organization typically will not last long. Again, this is a sharp difference from many big companies, where executives often serve more as administrators and bureaucrats.\n\n3. Be a team player—a startup executive must take personal responsibility for her relationships with her peers and people throughout the startup, in all functions and at all levels. Big companies can often tolerate internal rivalries and warfare; startups cannot.\n\nBeing a startup executive is not an easy job. The rewards are substantial—the ability to contribute directly to the startup’s success; the latitude to build and run an organization according to her own theories and principles; and a meaningful equity stake that can lead to personal financial independence if the startup succeeds—but the responsibilities are demanding and intense.\n\nFirst, if you’re not sure whether you need an executive for a function, don’t hire one. Startups, particularly well-funded startups, often hire executives too early. Particularly before a startup has achieved product/market fit, it is often better to have a highly motivated manager or director running a function than an executive. Hiring an executive too quickly can lead to someone who is really expensive, sitting there in the middle of the room, doing very little. Not good for the executive, not good for the rest of the team, not good for the burn rate, and not good for the company. Hire an executive only when it’s clear that you need one: when an organization needs to get built; when hiring needs to accelerate; when you need more processes and structure and rigor to how you do things.\n\nSecond, hire the best person for the next nine months, not the next three years. I’ve seen a lot of startups overshoot on their executive hires. They need someone to build the software development team from four people to 30 people over the next nine months, so they hire an executive from a big company who has been running 400 people. That is usually death. Hire for what you need now—and for roughly the next nine months. At the very least, you will get what you need now, and the person you hire may well be able to scale and keep going for years to come. In contrast, if you overhire—if you hear yourself saying, “this person will be great when we get bigger”—you are most likely hiring someone who, best case, isn’t that interested in doing things at the scale you need, and worst case, doesn’t know how.\n\nThird, whenever possible, promote from within. Great companies develop their own executives. There are several reasons for this: You get to develop your best people and turn them into executives, which is great for both them and you—this is the single best, and usually the only, way to hold onto great people for long periods of time. You ensure that your executives completely know and understand your company culture, strategy, and ethics. Your existing people are the “devil you know”—anyone new coming from outside is going to have flaws, often really serious ones, but you probably won’t figure out what they are until after you’ve hired them. With your existing people, you know, and you minimize your odds of being shocked and appalled. Of course, this isn’t always possible. Which segues us directly into...\n\nFourth, my list of the key things to look at, and for, when evaluating executive candidates:\n\nLook for someone who is hungry and driven—someone who wants a shot at doing “their thing”. Someone who has been an up-and-comer at a midsized company but wants a shot at being a primary executive at a startup can be a great catch. Flip side of that: beware people who have “done it before”. Sometimes you do run into someone who has been VP Engineering at four companies and loves it and wants to do it at a fifth company. More often, you will be dealing with someone who is no longer hungry and driven. This is a very, very big problem to end up with—be very careful.\n\nDon’t disqualify someone based on ego or cockiness—as long as she’s not insane. Great executives are high-ego—you want someone driven to run things, driven to make decisions, confident in herself and her abilities. I don’t mean loud and obnoxious, I mean assured and determined, bleeding over into cocky. If a VC’s ideal investment is a company that will succeed without him, then your ideal executive hire is someone who will succeed without you.\n\nBeware hiring a big company executive for a startup. The executive skill sets required for a big company vs a startup are very different. Even great big company executives frequently have no idea what to do once they arrive at a startup. In particular, really beware hiring an executive from an incredibly successful big company. This is often very tempting—who wouldn’t want to bring onboard someone who sprinkles some of that IBM (in the 80s), Microsoft (in the 90s), or Google (today) fairy dust on your startup? The issue is that people who have been at an incredibly successful big company often cannot function in a normal, real-world, competitive situation where they don’t start every day with 80% market share. Back in the 80s, you often heard, “never hire anyone straight out of IBM—first, let them go somewhere else and fail, and then hire them.” Believe it.\n\nThis probably goes without saying, but look for a pattern of output—accomplishment. Validate it by reference checking peers, reports, and bosses. Along the way, reference check personality and teamwork, but look first and foremost for a pattern of output.\n\n...",

"A Subnet for Synthetic Data to Power Price Forecasting for Agents and LLMs\n\nMode has launched the Synth testnet on Bittensor, the world’s largest decentralized AI network. The initiative introduces the Synth Subnet Testnet, which leverages Bittensor’s decentralized intelligence network to create the world's most powerful synthetic data, starting with BTC price.\n\nThis unlocks a powerful tool for AI Agents deployed on Mode. Up until now, the forecasting capabilities of AI Agents have been limited due to a lack of useful data to train on. Synth changes this by incentivizing miners to continuously submit synthetic models which capture the full distribution of possible price movements and their associated probabilities, creating the world’s most accurate synthetic data.\n\nThe project’s goal is to become the go-to location for asking questions on future price probability distributions.\n\n### What is a subnet?\n\nBittensor operates through a network consisting of smaller, specialized sub-networks (subnets), each dedicated to different areas of AI. Synth will join this network on testnet and leverage Bittensor’s sophisticated TAO economic model that incentivizes the production of high-value AI subnets. In the future, $MODE will be incorporated into a wider model for our AI Agents.\n\nInitially, Synth will see miners generate 100 simulated price paths for BTC every five minutes. Miners will be evaluated on how accurately they model the probability distribution of future prices and their ability to encapsulate realistic price dynamics, such as volatility clustering and skewed fat-tailed price change distributions. Validators will score miners by comparing their outputs to Pyth’s historical price data using a detailed scoring methodology.\n\n### Why is this important for Mode?\n\nMode is building this Subnet to improve the forecasting and probabilistic reasoning of Agents and LLMs across decentralized finance.\n\nInitially, it is expected that Synth’s models will be used for training AI Agents, options pricing models, and portfolio management. When the subnet is launched on Mainnet, applications and APIs will be built for builders to integrate with.\n\nSynth is designed to push the boundaries of what AI Agents can achieve through continuously improving synthetic data. For more information, visit the GitHub: github.com/mode-network/synth-subnet.\n\nA dedicated discord channel has been created in the Bittensor discord for discussion.\n\n### About Mode\n\nMode is the Layer 2 (L2) building at the intersection of DeFi and AI. Mode’s mission is to scale DeFi to billions of users through onchain agents and AI-powered financial applications.

    "Mode AIFi Accelerator: The AI Agents Are Here Announcing the Nine Visionary Teams Leading the Future of AIFi We are delighted to introduce the nine pioneering teams that have been selected to join the Mode AIFi Accelerator, each embodying the spirit of innovation at the intersection of decentralized finance (DeFi) and artificial intelligence (AI). These teams are not just building products - they are crafting the future of finance, harnessing AI to unlock new possibilities in automation, security, and accessibility. Together, we will chart new territory, transforming how billions of users interact with DeFi. A wide variety of projects will be deploying to Mode, including fully onchain AI Agent Infrastructure, DeFi agent training platforms, AI Asset Management, Security Agents, AI-generated front ends for protocols, Verifiable AI leveraging ZK and TEE, and even no-code model training from your phone. In the months ahead, Mode’s core contributors and partners will work hand-in-hand with these nine visionary teams, accelerating their journey toward realizing the full potential of AIFi. The Next Billion Users Are Agents At the heart of Mode’s vision lies a bold premise: the future of DeFi belongs to intelligent agents acting on behalf of users. These agents will simplify the complexities of yield management, security, and governance, operating autonomously to unlock financial opportunities at scale. To bring this vision to life, we are developing secure agent operating systems and frameworks that will empower developers to create and manage these agents seamlessly. AI Unlocking a New DeFi Paradigm AI is poised to revolutionize the DeFi landscape, transforming it from manual, user-driven processes to systems where agents autonomously manage financial strategies. This transition promises to lower barriers to entry, offering personalized decision-making and efficiency at a scale we’ve never seen before. Training Platform for DeFi Agents Almanak is using a comprehensive set of tools, including their Blockchain-Based Testing and Optimization Environment, which allows users to fork any EVM into the cloud to test and refine financial strategies in realistic blockchain conditions. Their Blockchain-Based Monte Carlo Simulator runs thousands of scenarios to evaluate risk/reward ratios, while their Blockchain-Based Agent Training System continuously tests strategies to find the best-performing one. Almanak also prioritizes privacy, operating off-chain to prevent reverse engineering of strategies. AI Asset Management Amplifi has developed an AI-powered cross-chain asset management protocol. Amplifi’s technology continuously analyzes on-chain data, dynamically distributing assets across ecosystems to optimize returns. With an emphasis on high, stable, and low-risk yields, their system is making DeFi more accessible to the everyday user. Solving Existing DeFi Challenges with AI While DeFi has opened a world of financial innovation, it also faces persistent challenges: security vulnerabilities, laborious auditing processes, and the complexity of navigating DeFi platforms. Additionally, user interfaces are often too intricate for those new to the ecosystem. At Mode, we see AI not as a hammer in search of a nail but as a key to unlocking solutions to these very real challenges. Security Agents QuillAI is advancing security within DeFi through its marketplace of AI-driven security agents. These agents offer continuous auditing, formal verification, and real-time monitoring, allowing developers to integrate security directly into their dApps. QuillAI’s intelligent systems evolve by analyzing blockchain transaction patterns, identifying new threats before they become systemic issues. AI-Generated Front Ends FortyTwo tackles DeFi’s user interface complexity by enabling developers to upload their smart contracts, allowing machine learning algorithms to extract relevant information and generate an appropriate UI. Developers can then tweak the features of the UI using natural language prompts, offering seamless customization. This generative UI approach simplifies the creation of DeFi front ends, lowering barriers for both developers and users. Value Creation Between AI and Crypto The convergence of AI and blockchain is a two-way street. Blockchain’s unique properties—a decentralized, permissionless network that reduces networking costs, immutability that guarantees data integrity, and token incentives that enable value capture through financialization—offer AI models a foundation for greater security, scalability, and transparency. In turn, AI’s ability to automate complex tasks creates more efficient, intelligent blockchain ecosystems. Verifiable AI Computation Inference Labs is leveraging zero-knowledge proof (ZK) verification to enable off-chain AI computations with complete transparency and privacy. Their zk cluster on Bittensor is already a top performer, having garnered more than 7,000 TAO from operating their subnet. Aizel is pioneering TEE-enabled verifiable AI on-chain, ensuring that AI computations are secure, transparent, and tamper-proof. This innovation enables decentralized applications to operate with trusted AI agents. No-Code Model Training from Your Phone Cerbo AI is democratizing AI development through their no-code platform, enabling users to build, fine-tune, and deploy machine learning models directly from their mobile devices. With federated learning at its core, Cerbo AI leverages edge device data to train global models securely on-chain.

    "Mode Blockchain DevDrop: Empowering Ecosystem Growth Through veMODE Staking. In a strategic move to foster growth and innovation within the Mode ecosystem, we are excited to announce the launch of the Mode DevDrop initiative. This drop will reward active and promising development teams contributing to the ecosystem with a claimable allocation of Mode tokens. The goal is to incentivize deeper engagement and long-term participation through staking and governance. Teams can claim tokens here: https://app.hedgey.finance/claim/b92f7714-f593-409b-b191-925310a0bf56. Key Details of the DevDrop: Token Claim for Eligible Teams: Development teams who have committed to Season 3 governance will receive the DevDrop and will be able to claim MODE tokens. These tokens are intended to be used as part of our commitment to encourage long-term alignment with the Mode blockchain’s mission. Staking for veMODE: We expect teams to stake their allocated tokens to receive veMODE, our vote-escrowed governance token. By staking, teams can actively participate in governance and help shape the future of the Mode ecosystem through voting. Monitoring Participation: To ensure the success of this initiative, we will closely monitor how teams engage with governance post-claim. Teams that stake and participate actively in voting will contribute to the overall health and direction of the ecosystem. Future Incentive Alignment: Teams that fail to stake or engage with governance could potentially be excluded from future token drops. This approach ensures that only those who are aligned with Mode’s long-term vision are rewarded, driving meaningful participation and fostering sustainable growth. Criteria: The Devdrop allocations range between 1,000,000 and 10,000,000 MODE. Only teams that have signed up to Season 3 governance by submitting a governance proposal have been included. The amount of tokens has been decided based on: Onchain impact to the Mode ecosystem - TVL and volume being primary metrics. Mode native or multichain - Mode native projects received higher allocations. Previous grants - other grants impacted the overall amounts given in the DevDrop. This initiative reflects Mode's commitment to empowering builders while ensuring that the ecosystem grows through active, value-aligned governance participation.

    "TLDR: Mode is launching veMODE and becoming the first L2 to implement a vote escrow model for the distribution of incentives to ecosystem protocols. veMODE is an upgrade to the current MODE staking module. Stakers will be rewarded for upgrading their staked MODE balance in order to take part in this new system. OP rewards start accruing immediately upon upgrade, claimable after successful voting participation. Key benefits: Staking to veMODE enables users to continue to earn OP and vote for the distribution of incentives to ecosystem protocols. $2m in incentives are available in Season 3 for veMODE holders to direct to ecosystem protocols. Mode ecosystem protocols must deploy all incentives to users on Mode to be eligible for future incentives. Mode ecosystem protocols can decide on which pools they distribute incentives to. Key innovations: Staking, not locking. Vote power increases with time staked. MODE and MODE/ETH liquidity tokens can be used to vote, increasing the productivity of participating tokens. Flexibility and upgradability. Vote for protocols, not pools - enabling teams to strategically target growth. Time-bound seasons. Lessons learned from Season 3 will be considered and applied to upgrade Season 4, enabling continuous innovation. Key dates: Thursday 17th October: Staking for Season 3 will go live. Friday 18th October: Users will be able to upgrade from the old Mode staking contract to the new veMODE Staking contract in the Mode dashboard to continue earning OP rewards. Wednesday 23rd October @ 23:59:59 UTC: veMODE and veBPT must be staked to be eligible to vote in the first Epoch. Thursday 24th October @ 00:00 UTC: Voting goes live. Wednesday 30th October 23:00 UTC: Voting Deadline. Voting deadlines are on the WEDNESDAY of each voting period. New voters must be staked 3 days prior to the end of each voting period to be eligible to vote (warm-up period). Week of Oct. 31st: First incentive distributions to protocols from results of gauge votes. Epochs are two weeks long, voting occurs the first week of each epoch. Season 3 will run for approximately 3 months, with 6 epochs. Introduction: Layer 2 blockchains are continuously experimenting with ways to foster community and network growth. Popular avenues include broad points and tasked-based systems, to governance structures using application-based stimulus programs and retroactive funding rewarding strategic initiatives. These programs have had mixed results, with lessons learned at every turn. Mode has had two Seasons of experimentation and has closely studied the landscape of growing ecosystems. Mode is in a unique position in having deep DeFi (Decentralized Finance) roots, focused on being the DeFi hub of the Superchain and evolving to scale DeFi by building the AIFi economy. DeFi has a rich history of experimenting with governance models and aligning protocol participants with network goals and ecosystem growth. Mode is proud to have worked alongside some of the most seasoned veterans in space, and has pieced together lessons and frameworks from DeFi’s battle-tested history to deliver a new chapter in L2 governance. Mode welcomes you to Season 3. Background: DeFi has delivered many innovations in managing governance and incentives across blockchain protocols. One of the most significant innovations has been the vote escrow (ve) token model, first introduced by Curve Finance. Curve Finance set the standard with its veCRV model, where users who locked their CRV tokens for longer durations gained more influence in governance decisions and protocol emissions. This model successfully aligned long-term holders and major liquidity providers (LPs) with the growth of the Curve protocol. As veCRV gained popularity, it paved the way for Convex Finance, which aggregated users’ veCRV holdings, allowing Convex to gain significant control over Curve’s governance. This type of “meta-governance” was an important lesson showing liquidity markets will typically arise for locked tokens. The success of these systems led to the rise of bribe markets. In these markets, protocols seeking to gain votes could offer incentives to veToken holders in exchange for governance support. This created a new way for veToken holders to earn additional rewards while also driving competition among protocols for governance influence. Solidly, another step in this evolution, introduced the ve(3,3) model, which incorporated veNFT gauge voting into the distribution of incentives, while rewarding the voters with trading fees. Shoutout to Andre Cronje for his pioneering work here. Gauge voting allowed protocols and large LPs to compete for a share of emissions based on votes from veToken holders, creating a more efficient and dynamic allocation of rewards. The hyperinflationary tokenomics design was an important lesson in the Solidly design, as trading fees alone paled in comparison to rewards from emissions, bringing into question long-term sustainability. Olympus DAO, post 2023, set a new standard in sustainable growth. After building a massive treasury through innovative bonding mechanisms, Olympus evolved from its rebasing roots in 2021 by completely shutting off inflation, only activating emissions to open bond markets when/if a healthy premium arises. The token floats in a price range sandwiching the moving average using automated configurations called Range Bound Stability (RBS). Today, Olympus uses the treasury to support the lower range RBS and the revenue to execute leveraged token buybacks. The lesson from Olympus is that a carefully managed, conservative, but productive treasury can sustain protocol growth without relying on inflationary tokenomics. Mode builds upon these innovations with its own governance system for Season 3. Mode's Innovation: The First ve-model for an L2. Building on this history, Mode is the first Layer 2 on the Optimism Superchain to implement a ve governance model. Mode isn’t just modeling the successes of past models; it’s innovating in several ways: 1. Seasonal Governance Each Mode season has a start and an end, which gives the system the ability to evolve and adapt quickly. Unlike static governance models that lock participants into long-term decisions, this seasonal approach allows Mode to fine-tune its governance structure based on the needs of its community and the overall market environment. Season 3 will consist of six, two-week epochs, spanning a total of three months. 2. Gauge Voting for Protocols, not Pools. Users on Mode can vote with either veMODE (acquired by staking MODE tokens) or veBPT (obtained by depositing in the 80/20 MODE-ETH liquidity pool on Balancer). Participants can vote on which protocols will receive incentives. Both veMODE and veBPT will direct separate batches of incentives. Voting for protocols empowers the protocols to strategically use the incentives for optimal growth. Community liquidity providers should work closely with protocols to align on incentivizing building healthy ecosystems. Protocols on Mode can apply for gauge eligibility at https://forum.mode.network/. 3. Incentivizing long-term commitment without locks There are no long-term locking mechanisms in Season 3, just warm-up/cool-down periods to ensure predictability and security in voting. Thus, stakers remain relatively liquid while participating in Season 3, free to come and go as they please. However, there are benefits in long-term participation. The longer a user stakes veTokens (veMODE or veBPT) the more voting power they will receive. Voters will see an exponential increase in voting power for each epoch staked, up to 6x if they stake for all six epochs. This increase in voting power corresponds with a gradually increasing incentive allocation for each epoch. This means more rewards are available for distribution in later epochs, encouraging early and long-term participation. 4. Rewards for participation Stakers will be eligible to claim OP rewards each epoch if they vote. 5. Bribe Markets (coming soon). Bribe markets might sound controversial at first, but in reality, they’ve become a critical piece of incentive-driven governance economies. Protocols that want to receive a share of Season 3 incentives must compete for votes from veMODE and veBPT holders. These holders can be “bribed” by protocols and motivated stakeholders to direct their votes accordingly. What makes this work is transparency—bribe markets, when done openly, create a win-win situation for both veToken holders and protocols. For veToken holders, it creates an additional reason and benefit to hold veTokens and participate in governance. For protocols, it enables them to grow their liquidity and strategic incentives with better capital efficiency. 6. Autonomous Agents (looking forward). We believe that governance participation today is flawed, as participation is often far lower than expected. In the future, people will be able to train an agent to express their views and vote on their behalf. Mode governance will become a testbed for Autonomous Agents to participate in on-chain voting, bringing a new age of efficiency. Tokenomics and Sustainability: How Incentives Work. One of the most important questions for any governance system is: where do the incentives come from, and are they sustainable? Starting with an Allocated Reserve. In Season 3, the incentives will initially come from OP grants and will transition to come from MODE allocations reserved for user and developer airdrops. This distribution is designed to continue to bootstrap ecosystem growth and incentivize early participation. Building Towards Sustainability. Mode isn't relying solely on reserves forever. As the protocol matures, the goal is to fund these incentives through revenue generated by an Olympus-like Smart Treasury. The treasury will generate revenue and use a portion as incentives to be directed toward the ecosystem by veToken holders, ensuring a sustainable model as the ecosystem grows. In Summary: Season 3 represents a pivotal moment for Mode as it launches the first ve- model on the Superchain, pioneering a dynamic and adaptable governance system. By focusing on staking rather than locking, empowering protocol voting over pool allocation, and incentivizing long-term engagement with exponential voting power growth, Mode is setting the stage for a sustainable DeFi evolution. With lessons learned from the broader DeFi ecosystem, Season 3's governance framework introduces flexibility and strategic growth opportunities, offering both participants and protocols a platform for collaboration. This adaptable, community-driven framework aims to power Mode’s mission to build the AIFi economy.

Stakers will be rewarded for upgrading their staked MODE balance in order to take part in this new system. OP rewards start accruing immediately upon upgrade, claimable after successful voting participation. Staking to veMODE enables users to continue to earn OP and vote for the distribution of incentives to ecosystem protocols. $2m in incentives are available in Season 3 for veMODE holders to direct to ecosystem protocols. Mode ecosystem protocols must deploy all incentives to users on Mode to be eligible for future incentives. Mode ecosystem protocols can decide on which pools they distribute incentives to. Staking, not locking. Vote power increases with time staked. MODE and MODE/ETH liquidity tokens can be used to vote, increasing the productivity of participating tokens. Flexibility and upgradability. Vote for protocols, not pools - enabling teams to strategically target growth. Time bound seasons. Lessons learned from Season 3 will be considered and applied to upgrade Season 4, enabling continuous innovation. Key dates: Thursday 17th October: Staking for Season 3 will go live. Friday 18th October: Users will be able to upgrade from the old Mode staking contract to the new veMODE Staking contract in the Mode dashboard to continue earning OP rewards. Wednesday 23rd October @ 23:59:59 UTC: veMODE and veBPT must be staked to be eligible to vote in the first Epoch. Thursday 24th October @ 00:00 UTC: Voting goes live. Wednesday 30th October 23:00 UTC: Voting Deadline. Voting deadlines are on the WEDNESDAY of each voting period. New voters must be staked 3 days prior to the end of each voting period to be eligible to vote (warm-up period). Week of Oct. 31st: First incentive distributions to protocols from results of gauge votes. Epochs are two weeks long; voting occurs in the first week of each epoch. Season 3 will run for approximately 3 months, with 6 epochs. Mode is building the AIFi economy to scale DeFi to billions of users. To learn more, visit https://mode.network/",

"Mode is proud to partner with Shutter to announce the impending launch of the Shutterized Mode testnet. Slated for release in the next three weeks, this initiative marks a crucial advance towards a fully MEV-aware Mode ecosystem. Our collaboration signifies not just technological integration but a shared vision for a network that is safer, more resistant to censorship, and protected against front-running—all while maintaining a stance of neutrality at the base layer. The Encrypted Mempool: A Cornerstone for MEV Strategy At the heart of our strategic development is the implementation of an encrypted mempool, poised to serve as a foundational element in Mode's comprehensive MEV-aware strategy. This innovative approach aims to foster sustainable MEV extraction and distribution methods related to back-running, thereby unlocking new revenue streams for our ecosystem. Background: A Tradition of Innovation Mode's adoption of Sequencer Fee Sharing (SFS) has already set a precedent for distributing sequencer fees among developers and applications built atop our platform. With the integration of revenue from MEV extraction, we anticipate introducing an additional layer of developer incentivization, further enriching our protocol's utility and appeal. The Testnet: A Dual-Focus Evaluation Our collaboration with Shutter will be showcased through a dedicated testnet, designed to assess two critical areas: The Implementation of a Shutterized Encrypted Mempool: Focused on front-running protection and real-time censorship resistance, this feature promises to enhance trading safety for DeFi users. A Two-Stage Back-Running MEV Extraction Strategy: This approach not only aligns with our vision for a more profitable trading environment but also ensures that developers and applications built on Mode are aptly rewarded, nurturing a vibrant ecosystem. Collaborative Milestones and Roadmap Building upon Shutter's roadmap for a Shutterized OP Stack testnet, this partnership endeavors to extend its reach. With the backing of the Optimism Collective for developing a generalized encryption interface, we're poised to revolutionize security and efficiency across DeFi. Our roadmap is ambitious, with the Shutterized Mode testnet launching in February 2024, followed by a Proof of Concept (PoC) for MEV extraction and the introduction of an MEV-aware Mode mainnet between Q2 and Q3 2024. By Q3 2024, we anticipate integrating MEV auctions, setting a new standard for transactional security and efficiency. Your Role in Shaping the Future The participation of our community in the upcoming testnet phase is not just encouraged—it's essential. Your feedback and insights will play a pivotal role in refining this collaboration. For more in-depth information, technological insights, and updates on our progress, we invite you to explore the detailed post on Shutter's blog. As we embark on this pioneering journey with Shutter, our commitment to delivering a secure, efficient, and equitable blockchain experience has never been stronger. The possibilities of this collaboration are boundless, and we look forward to exploring them with you, our community. Join us as we navigate this exciting new chapter in DeFi. Your support, participation, and feedback are invaluable as we work together to redefine the future of blockchain transactions. Here's to building a more secure and efficient DeFi ecosystem—together.

"Today we are excited to announce our commitment to the Optimism Collective’s Superchain vision. Mode will receive a substantial grant of up to 2,000,000 OP from the Optimism Foundation, a strategic move designed to drive user growth across the platform. This significant collaboration marks a new chapter in Mode's journey, aligning closely with the collective's mission to scale Ethereum and foster ecosystem growth. A Commitment to Collaborative Growth As part of this commitment, Mode will dedicate a portion of its sequencer revenue fees to the Optimism Collective. This move not only signifies Mode's support for the collective but also its active participation in the Law of Chains. This open neutrality framework is set to govern the Superchain, ensuring a fair and balanced ecosystem for all participants. Mode: The Superchain DeFi Hub Mode's mission is to establish itself as the DeFi hub within the Superchain. The platform is focused on nurturing native interoperable DeFi applications and infrastructure. This goal is to be achieved through the development of new economic systems within the protocol, enabling native yield and dynamic rewards powered by a smart treasury. James Ross, Mode’s founder, shares his enthusiasm: “The Superchain is a collaborative vision to scale Ethereum, and we see an opportunity to be the hub for experimental DeFi innovation. We are excited to work closely with the Optimism team to build out the future of onchain economies and create new incentive mechanisms for both builders and users.” Mainnet Launch and Growth Initiatives Mode is gearing up for its mainnet launch scheduled for the end of January, with the backing of the Optimism team. This launch will be accompanied by a series of growth initiatives, marking a significant step forward in Mode's development. Ryan Wyatt, Chief Growth Officer at Optimism Unlimited, expressed his excitement about Mode's integration into the Superchain ecosystem: “By committing development resources to the Superchain and sequencer revenue back to the Collective, Mode is demonstrating their values alignment to the project, and we’re looking forward to the ways they help expand DeFi opportunities for users.” Mode’s Role in the Superchain Mode's approach is centered around building onchain economic systems that foster sustainable growth, with a focus on quantitative and automated strategies. To date, Mode has successfully launched its Testnet, Developer Mainnet, and onboarded over 200 developers. We have also deployed our Sequencer Fee Sharing Module and conducted early research into Cooperative Game Theory. Looking ahead, Mode is set to develop open-source tools for Superchain teams, with plans to introduce native yield, smart treasuries, and onchain AI agents to the Superchain. Additionally, Mode is dedicating resources to the creation of public goods for the Superchain and developing open-source growth tools beneficial for dapp developers and other L2s. A Bright Future for Mode in the Optimism Ecosystem This collaboration marks an exciting era for the Optimism ecosystem. With the collective's mission to grow Ethereum gaining momentum, the Superchain is poised to keep growing innovative L2s like Base, Mode, Zora, and many others, each contributing uniquely to this vibrant and expanding community.",
"Dear Mode Community, Mode’s Airdrop 1 campaign will end on the 5th May.

Assets on Mode/TVL snapshots were taken on 29th April and 2nd May. If a user bridges off Mode during the vesting period they will receive a pro-rata amount of tokens based on the time and assets on Mode during the vesting period. Examples: A user that bridges off Mode at the start of Season 2 and does not bridge back will forfeit their vested tokens. The tokens forfeited will be added to the total tokens available for Airdrop 2.A user that keeps their assets on Mode for 45 days and then bridges off Mode will receive 50% of their vested tokens. A user that keeps their assets on Mode for 45 days and bridges off for 22.5 days, then bridges back their assets for 22.5 days will receive 75% of their vested tokens. \\n\\n**If I have vested tokens and I bridged off Mode in Season 1 and now have a smaller amount of assets on Mode what will be the asset base for the vesting period**\\n\\nOngoing Snapshots have been taken of the top wallets during Season 1. If a user bridged off Mode then they may not receive the full vested amount of tokens. Users can bridge back at anytime to be eligible through the vesting period on a pro-rata basis. \\n\\n**If I have vested tokens are you tracking TVL in $ on Mode or the balance of assets in a wallet on Mode?** \\n\\nFor users with vesting we track the assets in a wallet overtime. If a user is active onchain and does not move assets to another wallet or bridge off Mode then they will receive their full vesting. If not they will receive a pro-rata amount"
